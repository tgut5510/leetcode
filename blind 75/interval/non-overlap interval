Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    
    
brute force solution
optimize solution
