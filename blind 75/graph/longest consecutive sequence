Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    
    
brute force solution
optimize solution
time / space complexity
